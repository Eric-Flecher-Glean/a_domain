  title: Fix Makefile submodule paths for automated quality checks
  description: "Makefile targets reference .sdlc/make/*.mk files that don't resolve\
    \ correctly, breaking automated quality validation.\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:\n\
    - File: Makefile (lines 5-13)\n- Current behavior: Make cannot find .sdlc/make/*.mk\
    \ files\n- Actual location: Files exist in .sdlc submodule but paths don't resolve\n\
    - Impact:\n  * make validate-governance fails to run\n  * make test-all fails\
    \ to run\n  * Quality gates require manual verification instead of automation\n\
    \  * Story completion checklist cannot use automated targets\n\nEvidence:\n```\n\
    $ make validate-governance\nMakefile:5: .sdlc/make/governance.mk: No such file\
    \ or directory\nMakefile:6: .sdlc/make/testing.mk: No such file or directory\n\
    Makefile:7: .sdlc/make/backlog.mk: No such file or directory\nmake: *** No rule\
    \ to make target `.sdlc/make/monitor.mk'.  Stop.\n```\n\nFiles exist in submodule:\n\
    ```\n$ ls .sdlc/make/\n# Files should be listed but make can't find them\n```\n\
    \nRoot Cause:\nThe .sdlc directory is a git submodule. The Makefile include paths\
    \ assume the submodule\nis checked out and files are accessible, but the paths\
    \ may not be resolving correctly\ndue to:\n1. Submodule not initialized in fresh\
    \ clones\n2. Include paths not accounting for submodule structure\n3. Missing\
    \ -include directive (non-fatal includes)\n4. Working directory context when make\
    \ runs\n\nRECOMMENDED CHANGES:\n1. Verify submodule initialization in Makefile:\n\
    \   ```makefile\n   # Check if .sdlc submodule is initialized\n   SDLC_INITIALIZED\
    \ := $(shell test -f .sdlc/make/governance.mk && echo yes || echo no)\n\n   ifeq\
    \ ($(SDLC_INITIALIZED),no)\n   $(error .sdlc submodule not initialized. Run: git\
    \ submodule update --init --recursive)\n   endif\n   ```\n\n2. Use -include for\
    \ optional files (allows graceful degradation):\n   ```makefile\n   -include .sdlc/make/governance.mk\n\
    \   -include .sdlc/make/testing.mk\n   ```\n\n3. Add explicit SDLC_DIR variable:\n\
    \   ```makefile\n   SDLC_DIR := .sdlc\n   include $(SDLC_DIR)/make/governance.mk\n\
    \   ```\n\n4. Add helper target to initialize submodule:\n   ```makefile\n   .PHONY:\
    \ sdlc-init\n   sdlc-init:\n   \t@git submodule update --init --recursive\n  \
    \ \t@echo \"✅ .sdlc submodule initialized\"\n   ```\n\n5. Document in README that\
    \ submodule must be initialized:\n   ```markdown\n   ## Setup\n   git clone <repo>\n\
    \   git submodule update --init --recursive  # Required!\n   make help\n   ```\n\
    \nTesting:\n- Clone repo fresh (without submodules)\n- Run make validate-governance\n\
    - Verify helpful error or auto-init\n- After init, verify make targets work\n\
    - Test make test-all\n- Test make backlog-status\n"

  title: A/B Agent Demo - Proof of Concept
  description: 'Build minimal working demo of A/B agent collaboration with observability.


    Goal: Prove the agent-to-agent architecture works and can be observed in real-time.


    Components:

    - Agent A (Generator): Creates prompts/tasks/content

    - Agent B (Validator): Reviews, validates, and provides feedback

    - Observation Layer: Real-time visualization in Report Explorer


    Implementation:

    - Use existing ProtocolBrokerAgent for communication

    - Use existing Journey Orchestration for workflow

    - Add observability hooks to Report Explorer

    - Create demo script showing A↔B interaction loop


    Business Value:

    - Validates architecture in days vs weeks

    - Provides observable A/B pattern foundation

    - Enables rapid iteration on agent collaboration

    - Can evolve into production features


    Success Criteria:

    - Agent A and Agent B communicate via protocol bridge

    - Message flow visible in Report Explorer

    - Generate-validate-refine loop observable

    - Can run demo and watch agents collaborate in real-time

  title: Enhanced Journey Orchestration with A/B Agent Patterns
  description: 'Extend Journey Orchestration framework with reusable A/B agent patterns.


    Goal: Make A/B collaboration a first-class pattern in the orchestration framework.


    Patterns to Implement:

    1. Generate-Validate: One agent generates, another validates

    2. Propose-Critique-Refine: Iterative improvement loop

    3. Parallel-Consensus: Multiple agents propose, reach consensus

    4. Sequential-Handoff: Chain of specialized agents


    Implementation:

    - Extend Unit of Work Executor with A/B workflow templates

    - Add pattern definitions to workflow DSL

    - Enhance observability to highlight A↔B interactions

    - Create reusable agent base classes for each pattern


    Business Value:

    - Accelerates building new A/B features

    - Provides proven patterns for agent collaboration

    - Reduces implementation time by 50%

    - Observable collaboration out of the box


    Success Criteria:

    - 4 A/B patterns available as templates

    - Can create new A/B workflow in <1 hour

    - All patterns include observability hooks

    - Documentation with examples for each pattern

  title: Add framework version tracking with .sdlc-config.lock
  description: 'Create version lock file to track installed framework version, commit
    hash, and integrity.

    This enables version validation, compatibility checking, and audit trail for framework
    updates.


    Problem:

    - No tracking of which framework version is installed

    - Cannot detect outdated frameworks

    - No compatibility validation between framework and project


    Solution:

    - Create .sdlc-config.lock file with version, commit hash, install timestamp

    - Track integrity hash for validation

    - Include compatibility requirements (min Python, Make versions)


    Impact:

    - Foundation for all version management features

    - Enables migration system and rollback

    - Provides audit trail for framework state

  title: Implement migration system for framework version updates
  description: 'Add .sdlc/migrations/ directory with migration scripts for breaking
    changes between versions.

    Migration system auto-detects migration path and runs scripts with pre/post validation.


    Problem:

    - Breaking changes between versions break projects

    - No automated migration path

    - Manual updates error-prone


    Solution:

    - Create .sdlc/migrations/ directory structure

    - Migration scripts named like 1.0.0-to-1.1.0.sh

    - Auto-detect migration path (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 → 1.2.0)

    - Pre/post validation hooks

    - Rollback on migration failure


    Impact:

    - Breaking changes don''t break projects

    - Safe, automated version updates

    - Clear migration documentation

  title: Add --version, --migrate, --dry-run flags to update.sh
  description: 'Enhance bootstrap/update.sh to support version-pinned updates with
    migration.

    Add compatibility validation to block incompatible updates.


    Problem:

    - Current update.sh always pulls latest (no version control)

    - No dry-run preview

    - No automatic migration execution

    - No compatibility checks


    Solution:

    - Add --version v1.2.0 flag for pinned updates

    - Add --migrate flag to automatically run migrations

    - Add --dry-run to preview changes without executing

    - Validate compatibility before update

    - Block incompatible updates with clear error messages


    Impact:

    - Controlled, safe updates

    - Preview changes before applying

    - Automatic migration execution

    - Prevent breaking updates

  title: Replace single backup with multi-version backup retention
  description: 'Store backups in .sdlc-versions/{version}/ instead of .sdlc.backup/.

    Retain configurable number of versions (default: 3) with automatic pruning.


    Problem:

    - Single .sdlc.backup/ gets overwritten on each update

    - Cannot rollback to older versions

    - No backup history


    Solution:

    - Store backups as .sdlc-versions/1.0.0/, .sdlc-versions/1.1.0/, etc.

    - Configurable retention policy (default: last 3 versions)

    - Automatic pruning of old backups

    - Backup integrity verification


    Impact:

    - Multiple rollback points

    - Safer updates (can rollback further)

    - Automatic cleanup prevents disk bloat

    - No rollback mechanism

    - Manual restoration error-prone

    - Risky updates (can''t easily undo)


    Solution:

    - Create .sdlc/bootstrap/rollback.sh

    - rollback.sh --to v1.0.0 restores framework to v1.0.0

    - Validates backup exists and is complete

    - Updates .sdlc-config.lock

    - Completes in <30 seconds


    Impact:

    - Safe experimentation with updates

    - Quick recovery from failed updates

    - Confidence in version management

  title: Implement /sdlc.initialize command for repeatable framework installation
    testing
  description: 'Create comprehensive framework initialization system with intelligent
    YAML handling.


    Problem:

    - No way to test framework installation repeatably

    - No YAML repair/migration capability

    - No safe teardown mechanism

    - Cannot verify installation integrity


    Solution:

    - yaml_repair.py: Auto-detect schema version, repair metadata/counts/timestamps

    - teardown.sh: Safe removal with timestamped backups

    - setup-test.sh: Five-phase orchestration (pre-checks → teardown → install → YAML
    → verify)

    - Make targets: interactive, dry-run, force modes

    - Slash command + skill handler


    Impact:

    - Enables repeatable testing of framework installation

    - Provides YAML repair and migration capabilities

    - State preservation guarantees (never loses user data)

    - Supports CI/CD with force mode

  title: Fix schema path mismatch in backlog_validator.py
  description: "backlog_validator.py looks for schema at wrong path causing validation\
    \ to be skipped.\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:\n- File: .sdlc/core/backlog_validator.py\n\
    - Line: ~206 (schema_path definition)\n- Current behavior: Looks for \"schema/implementation_backlog_schema.json\"\
    \n- Actual location: \".sdlc/config/backlog_schema.json\"\n- Impact: Schema validation\
    \ silently skipped with warning\n\nEvidence:\n```\n$ make backlog-status\n⚠️ \
    \ Schema file not found: schema/implementation_backlog_schema.json (skipping schema\
    \ validation)\n```\n\nRoot Cause:\nThe validator uses a hardcoded relative path\
    \ that doesn't match the framework structure.\nWhen run from project root, \"\
    schema/\" directory doesn't exist - schema is in \".sdlc/config/\".\n\nRECOMMENDED\
    \ CHANGES:\n1. Update backlog_validator.py line ~206:\n   FROM: schema_path =\
    \ Path(\"schema/implementation_backlog_schema.json\")\n   TO:   schema_path =\
    \ Path(\".sdlc/config/backlog_schema.json\")\n\n2. Add fallback logic for different\
    \ execution contexts:\n   ```python\n   schema_candidates = [\n       Path(\"\
    .sdlc/config/backlog_schema.json\"),  # From project root\n       Path(\"../config/backlog_schema.json\"\
    ),      # From .sdlc/core/\n       Path(\"config/backlog_schema.json\"),     \
    \    # From .sdlc/\n   ]\n   schema_path = next((p for p in schema_candidates\
    \ if p.exists()), None)\n   ```\n\n3. Error instead of warning if schema not found\
    \ (fail-fast):\n   ```python\n   if not schema_path or not schema_path.exists():\n\
    \       print(f\"❌ Schema file required but not found\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n\
    \   ```\n\nTesting:\n- Verify from project root: make backlog-status (should not\
    \ warn)\n- Verify from .sdlc/: uv run core/backlog_validator.py\n- Verify schema\
    \ validation actually runs (test with invalid YAML)\n"

  title: Fix artifact registrar to scan .sdlc/ directory files
  description: "Artifact registrar only scans 6 files and misses new .sdlc/ implementation\
    \ files.\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:\n- File: .sdlc/core/artifact_registrar.py\n-\
    \ Current behavior: Scans 6 files, finds 0 unmapped after adding 5 new files\n\
    - Expected: Should find 5 new unmapped files in .sdlc/ directory\n- Impact: New\
    \ framework files not tracked in artifact registry\n\nEvidence:\n```\n$ make register-artifacts\n\
    Found 6 artifacts\nStories Updated: 0\nUnmapped Artifacts: 0\n```\n\nAfter adding:\n\
    - .sdlc/core/yaml_repair.py (631 lines)\n- .sdlc/bootstrap/teardown.sh (208 lines)\n\
    - .sdlc/bootstrap/setup-test.sh (437 lines)\n- .sdlc/commands/sdlc:sdlc.initialize.md\
    \ (402 lines)\n- .sdlc/skills/sdlc.initialize.md (427 lines)\n\nRoot Cause Hypothesis:\n\
    1. Artifact registrar may exclude .sdlc/ directory from scanning\n2. May only\
    \ scan project files (src/, tests/, etc.) not framework files\n3. May have glob\
    \ pattern that doesn't match .sdlc/**/*\n4. May have explicit .sdlc/ exclusion\
    \ in gitignore-style filtering\n\nRECOMMENDED CHANGES:\n1. Investigate artifact_registrar.py\
    \ scanning logic:\n   - Check scan_paths configuration\n   - Review exclusion\
    \ patterns\n   - Verify glob patterns include .sdlc/\n\n2. Update scan configuration\
    \ to include .sdlc/ files:\n   ```python\n   scan_paths = [\n       \"src/**/*.py\"\
    ,\n       \"tests/**/*.py\",\n       \".sdlc/core/**/*.py\",        # Add framework\
    \ core\n       \".sdlc/bootstrap/**/*.sh\",   # Add bootstrap scripts\n      \
    \ \".sdlc/commands/**/*.md\",    # Add command definitions\n       \".sdlc/skills/**/*.md\"\
    ,      # Add skill handlers\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. Add configuration option for framework\
    \ file tracking:\n   ```python\n   config = {\n       \"scan_framework_files\"\
    : True,  # Track .sdlc/ files\n       \"framework_patterns\": [\n           \"\
    .sdlc/core/**/*.py\",\n           \".sdlc/bootstrap/**/*.sh\",\n           \"\
    .sdlc/commands/**/*.md\",\n           \".sdlc/skills/**/*.md\",\n       ]\n  \
    \ }\n   ```\n\n4. Consider separate artifact registry for framework vs project:\n\
    \   - framework_artifact_registry: .sdlc/ files\n   - project_artifact_registry:\
    \ src/, tests/ files\n\nTesting:\n- Create test file in .sdlc/core/\n- Run make\
    \ register-artifacts\n- Verify file detected as unmapped artifact\n- Verify framework\
    \ files appear in artifact counts\n"

    Problem:

    - Agents from different domains cannot communicate without hard-coded integrations

    - No standard interface for agent discovery, capability negotiation, or data exchange


    Solution:

    - Design protocol specification (JSON-based message format)

    - Implement ProtocolBrokerAgent for message routing

    - Create capability registry for agent discovery


    Required Components:

    - Protocol message schema (JSON)

    - ProtocolBrokerAgent: Manages handshakes, negotiates contracts, routes messages

    - Agent registry for capability publishing

    Solution:

    - CapabilityDiscoveryAgent: Publishes agent capabilities, allows queries

    - Maintains compatibility matrix between agents

    - Enables intent-based discovery (e.g., "intent:provision_test_dataset")

  description: 'Automate dataset provisioning and teardown for client environments.


    Problem:

    - Manual dataset creation takes 2-3 days

    - No automated cleanup, leaving orphaned datasets

    Solution:

    - DatasetProvisioningAgent: Creates datasets from templates

    - Populates with mock data from medtronic_mock_data

    - Configures Glean data connectors

    - DataTeardownAgent: Safely removes datasets when stage complete

  title: Requirements Chat - SDLC Control Plane & Interactive Roadmap
  description: 'Interactive requirements gathering for SDLC Control Plane using /sdlc.new-feature-chat.


    Purpose:

    - Transform static roadmap HTML into interactive SDLC control plane

    - Enable browser-based workflow execution via Textual terminal integration

    - Provide smart recommendations for next SDLC actions based on backlog state


    Current Problem:

    - Roadmap HTML is static visualization only (no interaction)

    - Engineers context-switch between browser (viewing) and terminal (executing)

    - No recommended next actions based on backlog priority and state

    - Cannot execute SDLC workflows from browser


    Proposed Solution Components:

    1. Linear Backlog View: New web component showing prioritized stories in execution
    order

    2. Smart Recommendation Engine: Analyzes backlog state → suggests next action
    (/implement, /test, /quality)

    3. Textual Terminal Integration: 100% horizontal pane running Claude Code in browser

    4. Tabbed Button Bar: Click-to-execute SDLC commands in Textual UI

    5. Browser-Terminal Bridge: WebSocket/API layer connecting web app context to
    terminal


    Design Sprint Deliverables:

    - Technical architecture document (browser ↔ Textual ↔ Claude Code integration)

    - Smart recommendation algorithm specification

    - UX wireframes (linear backlog + button bar layout)

    - Feasibility analysis (Textual in browser via textual serve/textual-web)

    - Session management design (maintaining Claude Code context across clicks)

    - Security model (browser-initiated SDLC command execution)


    Strategic Value:

    - Shortens cycle time by giving Claude Code direct access to user''s current state

    - User views roadmap/backlog in browser → system recommends next action → executes
    in-browser

    - Eliminates context switching between visualization and execution environments


    Success Criteria:

    - Complete architecture covering all 5 components

    - Feasibility validated for running Textual in browser via textual serve

    - UX mockups show seamless roadmap → action → execution flow

    - Technical design enables full Claude Code capabilities in browser terminal

  title: 'Example: Direct Glean Agent Invocation - Customer Pain Point Extractor'
  description: 'Example story demonstrating Glean MCP agent implementation pattern.


    **Approach**: Direct mcp__glean__chat invocation (no XML template)

    **Purpose**: Show how to integrate existing Glean agents via `mcp__glean__chat`
    tool


    **Use Case**: Extract customer pain points from Gong call transcripts using the
    existing "Extract Common Pain Points" Glean agent.


    **Implementation Approach**:

    - Access pre-configured Glean agent via MCP

    - Pass context (industry, timeframe, customer segment)

    - Receive structured pain point analysis

    - Integrate results into requirements backlog


    **Benefits of Glean MCP Pattern**:

    - Zero implementation cost (agent already exists)

    - Battle-tested (used by 222 customers)

    - Multi-source integration (Gong + HubSpot + Teams + Salesforce + Zoom)

    - Agentic looping enabled for complex analysis

    - Enterprise security model built-in

  description: 'Example story demonstrating XML Prompt agent implementation pattern.


    **Approach**: XML template + mcp__glean__chat invocation

    **Purpose**: Show how to create custom agents using XML prompts from Eric-Flecher-Glean/prompts
    repository


    **Use Case**: Extract acceptance criteria from user story text using custom NLP-based
    extraction.


    **Implementation Approach**:

    - Define XML prompt structure (role, task, instructions, constraints)

    - Store in Eric-Flecher-Glean/prompts repository

    - Version control with semantic versioning

    - Load and execute prompt with user story text as input

    - Parse structured output (list of acceptance criteria)


    **Benefits of XML Prompt Pattern**:

    - Rapid development (minutes vs. days for full Glean agent)

    - Fine-grained control over prompt structure

    - Version-controlled in Git

    - Easy to review and iterate

    - Reusable across projects

  title: Correct Agent Implementation Pattern Documentation - XML Prompts as Glean
    MCP Templates
  description: The current documentation (ADR-006, agent-implementation-guide.md,
    and example stories P1-EXAMPLE-001/002) incorrectly describes two separate agent
    patterns. The correct architecture is that XML prompts stored in Eric-Flecher-Glean/prompts
    are templates that structure messages sent TO existing Glean MCP agents via mcp__glean__chat
    tool. This story corrects all documentation, examples, and backlog descriptions
    to reflect the unified pattern where XML prompts enhance Glean agent interactions
    rather than being an alternative implementation approach.
