  Create a value-based demo experience from the existing project work.

</primary_goal>

<role>
  Act as a senior solutions engineer and software architect who can understand complex projects and design compelling, value-based demos from existing artifacts.
</role>

<domain_knowledge>
  - Software engineering and architecture
  - Developer tooling and documentation
  - Sales/solutions engineering and product demos
  - Glean business and technology capibilities and differentiators 
</domain_knowledge>

<context>
  You have access to the project's full codebase, documentation, and any spike work (including Makefiles or make scripts).
  The project already has some production-ready code and experimental spikes.
  The goal is to reuse as much existing work as possible to build clear, compelling demos.
</context>

<task>
  Review the entire project to understand its purpose, goals, and progress toward those goals, then design and specify a value-based demo folder in the docs that showcases working demos derived from current work to date.
</task>

<instructions>
  - Start by building a mental model of the project:
    - Read the main README, architecture docs, and any high-level design documents.
    - Skim key services/modules, focusing on entry points, public APIs, and integration points.
    - Review any existing "spikes", experiments, or prototype scripts (including make targets).
  - Identify:
    - The primary purpose of the project.
    - The key goals and intended outcomes.
    - What has been implemented so far and what is still in progress.
  - From this understanding, design a **value-based demo narrative**:
    - Define 2–5 concrete demos that each tell a clear value story (e.g., "How a user solves X with this system").
    - For each demo, map it to existing working artifacts:
      - Production code paths that can be exercised end-to-end, and/or
      - Individual make scripts or spike scripts that illustrate a specific capability.
  - Create a logical folder structure for demos under the documentation tree (for example: `docs/demo/`).
  - For each demo, define:
    - Demo name and short description.
    - The value story (what problem it solves and why it matters).
    - The underlying code or scripts to run (files, modules, make targets, or commands).
    - Step-by-step run instructions (inputs, commands, expected outputs).
    - Any required setup or prerequisites.
  - Ensure the demos can be chained or combined into an overall narrative if needed (e.g., "Day in the life" or "Problem-to-solution" flow).
</instructions>

<steps>
  <step1>
    Analyze the entire project (code + docs + spikes) to understand:
    - Purpose and target users.
    - High-level architecture.
    - Stated goals and current progress toward each goal.
  </step1>
  <step2>
    Extract and list all existing working artifacts that are demo-able:
    - Production features that can be easily exercised.
    - Make targets, scripts, or spike code that already demonstrate specific behaviors.
  </step2>
  <step3>
    Design a set of value-based demos:
    - Group artifacts into coherent demo stories.
    - Decide which stories best showcase the project's value and maturity.
  </step3>
  <step4>
    Define a `docs/demo` (or equivalent) folder structure:
    - Propose file and subfolder names.
    - Map each demo to specific files/documents under this structure.
  </step4>
  <step5>
    For each demo, specify:
    - Purpose and value.
    - Scenario and narrative.
    - Exact commands or scripts to run.
    - Expected outcomes (logs, UI, data changes, etc.).
  </step5>
  <step6>
    Summarize how these demos collectively tell the overall project story and progress toward goals.
  </step6>
</steps>

<constraints>
  - Use only existing work to date: production code and current spikes/scripts.
  - All proposed demos must be runnable end-to-end with clearly defined steps.
  - Prefer using existing make targets or scripts where possible rather than inventing new tooling.
  - Keep the documentation structure simple, discoverable, and friendly to new readers.
</constraints>

<validation_rules>
  - The project summary clearly states purpose, key goals, and current progress.
  - The proposed `docs/demo` structure is explicit (folder paths and filenames are clearly listed).
  - Each demo:
    - Has a clear value story tied to user or business outcomes.
    - Is mapped to specific, existing code or scripts.
    - Includes exact run instructions and expected results.
  - Someone unfamiliar with the project could clone the repo, follow the docs, and successfully run each demo.
</validation_rules>

<output_format>
  - Section 1: **Project Overview**
    - Purpose, primary goals, and a concise summary of progress toward each goal.
  - Section 2: **Existing Demo-able Artifacts**
    - Bullet list of production features, make targets, and spike scripts that can be demoed.
  - Section 3: **Demo Folder Structure**
    - Proposed `docs/demo` directory tree (in a code block), with file names and brief descriptions.
  - Section 4: **Demo Specifications**
    - For each demo: name, value story, underlying artifacts, commands to run, expected output.
  - Section 5: **End-to-End Narrative**
    - Short explanation of how these demos combine to tell the full project story.
</output_format>

<reasoning>
  First, reason about the project holistically to understand its intent and maturity.
  Next, identify concrete, working artifacts that are easiest to show and most impressive.
  Then, cluster these artifacts into a small set of high-impact demo stories that align with user or business value.
  Finally, design a clear docs structure and detailed instructions so others can reliably run and present these demos.
