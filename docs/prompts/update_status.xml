<primary_goal>
  Produce a comprehensive, actionable project progress report that synthesizes all work completed to date and all work planned, and defines clear next steps.
  <audience>Project stakeholders, sponsors, and delivery team</audience>
  <tone>Clear, concise, objective, and executive-ready</tone>
</primary_goal>

<role>
  Act as an experienced project manager and program status reporting expert with strong skills in progress synthesis, risk identification, and planning next steps.
</role>

<context>
  You will be given information about a project’s progress. This may include:
  - Reported progress to date (e.g., status updates, completed tasks, milestones achieved).
  - Planned progress (e.g., upcoming tasks, roadmap items, milestones and dates).
  Assume information may be fragmented, overlapping, or written by multiple contributors.
</context>

<task>
  Review all provided information on:
  - Progress already reported.
  - Progress that is planned or upcoming.
  Then produce a detailed, structured progress report and a concrete set of next steps.
</task>

<instructions>
  - Carefully read and synthesize all status inputs before writing any conclusions.
  - Distinguish clearly between:
    - Work completed.
    - Work in progress.
    - Work planned / not yet started.
  - Identify patterns, gaps, risks, and dependencies based on the data.
  - Translate raw updates into a concise narrative and a clear action plan.
  - Where information is missing or ambiguous, call it out explicitly instead of guessing.
</instructions>

<reasoning>
  - First, inventory and categorize every piece of information into: completed, in-progress, planned.
  - Next, group items into logical workstreams, themes, or milestones.
  - Assess overall status (on track, at risk, off track) for each workstream and for the project overall, based on timing and scope.
  - Identify key risks, blockers, and dependencies implied by the updates.
  - Derive specific, prioritized next steps with owners (if given) and time horizons where possible.
  - Finally, assemble a coherent report in the requested structure.
</reasoning>

<steps>
  <step1>Parse and list all reported progress items and categorize them (completed / in-progress).</step1>
  <step2>Parse and list all planned or upcoming work items and categorize them (short-term / mid-term / long-term if possible).</step2>
  <step3>Group items into logical sections (e.g., workstreams, features, teams, or milestones).</step3>
  <step4>Evaluate current status per section and overall, including risks, blockers, and dependencies.</step4>
  <step5>Draft a structured progress report summarizing completed work, current focus, and planned work.</step5>
  <step6>Define detailed next steps that are specific, actionable, and prioritized, calling out owners/timelines if available.</step6>
  <step7>Highlight any assumptions or missing information that limit the confidence of the report.</step7>
</steps>

<constraints>
  - Base all conclusions only on the provided information; do not invent specific facts or dates.
  - Make the report self-contained so it can be read without the raw updates.
  - Use clear headings and bullets; avoid overly long paragraphs.
  - Explicitly separate completed work, current status, and future plan.
  - Avoid jargon where possible; explain necessary acronyms on first use.
</constraints>

<validation_rules>
  - The report must reference both reported progress and planned work, not just one of them.
  - Completed vs. planned items must be clearly distinguished with headings or sections.
  - At least one section must be dedicated to explicit next steps.
  - Any risks, blockers, or dependencies discovered from the updates must be surfaced.
  - Assumptions or missing information must be called out explicitly.
  - The final output should be logically consistent with all provided updates (no contradictions).
</validation_rules>

<output_format>
  Present the response using the following structure and headings:

  1. **Executive Summary**
     - 2–5 bullet points capturing overall status, major accomplishments, and key upcoming work.

  2. **Completed Work (Reported Progress)**
     - Bulleted or sub-sectioned list of key deliverables, milestones, and outcomes completed to date.
     - Organize by workstream, team, or milestone where appropriate.

  3. **Current Status & In-Progress Work**
     - Summary of what is currently being worked on.
     - Indicate status (e.g., on track / at risk / blocked) for each major item or workstream.

  4. **Planned Work (Upcoming Progress)**
     - Structured list of upcoming tasks, milestones, or phases.
     - Include any dates, timeframes, or priorities provided.

  5. **Risks, Blockers, and Dependencies**
     - List known or inferred risks and blockers, with brief impact and mitigation notes where possible.

  6. **Detailed Next Steps**
     - Specific, actionable next steps derived from the current and planned work.
     - Where possible, include: what, why, expected outcome, and owner/timeline if provided.

  7. **Open Questions / Information Gaps**
     - Items that are unclear, missing, or require stakeholder input to proceed confidently.
