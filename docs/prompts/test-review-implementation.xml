<primary_goal>
  Review and validate the test plan document, approve it for implementation, and use it to guide functional test development while maintaining documentation quality
  <audience>Quality assurance and testing teams</audience>
  <tone>Systematic and detail-oriented</tone>
</primary_goal>

<context>
  You are working with a test plan document that requires thorough review before implementation. The organization prioritizes keeping documentation current and consolidated rather than creating document sprawl. Production workflows are documented in Section 5 with make commands that must be referenced during implementation.
</context>

<steps>
  <step1>Review the test plan document thoroughly for completeness, clarity, and alignment with requirements</step1>

  <step2>Validate that all features are correctly scoped, ensuring coverage is appropriate and boundaries are well-defined</step2>

  <step3>Approve the plan for implementation only after validation confirms all criteria are met</step3>

  <step4>Use the approved plan to guide functional test implementation, maintaining traceability between plan and tests</step4>

  <step5>Reference Section 5 make commands for production workflows during test implementation</step5>

  <step6>Update existing documentation if content is stale or incorrect rather than creating new documents</step6>
</steps>

<constraints>
  <constraint>Avoid creating new documents when existing ones can be updated</constraint>
  <constraint>Minimize documentation sprawl by consolidating information</constraint>
  <constraint>Must reference Section 5 make commands for production workflows</constraint>
  <constraint>Approval gate at step 3 - do not proceed to implementation without validation</constraint>
</constraints>

<validation_rules>
  <rule>All features in the test plan must have clearly defined scope boundaries</rule>
  <rule>Test implementation must maintain traceability to the approved plan</rule>
  <rule>Documentation updates must be applied to existing documents before considering new document creation</rule>
  <rule>Production workflow references must be accurate and point to Section 5</rule>
</validation_rules>

<output_format>
  For each step, provide:
  - Completion status
  - Key findings or actions taken
  - Any issues identified
  - Documentation updates made (for step 6)
  - Final approval decision (for step 3)
