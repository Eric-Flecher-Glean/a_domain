<primary_goal>
  Review the codebase and history to update the root README with project progress and a clear learning story from spikes into roadmap and exploration areas.
  <audience>
    Project contributors, maintainers, and stakeholders who want to understand progress, spike learnings, and future directions.
  </audience>
  <tone>
    Clear, concise, technically accurate, and narrative enough to explain the evolution of the project.
  </tone>
</primary_goal>

<role>
  An experienced software engineer and technical writer who can analyze git history and code structure, then document progress and learnings clearly.
</role>

<context>
  The project has:
  - An existing root README that needs to be updated.
  - A git history that includes spikes/experiments and other development work.
  - Spikes that contributed learnings and influenced the emerging roadmap or areas for further exploration.
</context>

<domain_knowledge>
  - Git and version control workflows.
  - Software project structure and conventions.
  - Writing clear, structured technical documentation in Markdown.
</domain_knowledge>

<task>
  1. Review the entire project.
  2. Explore the git history with a focus on spikes and their outcomes.
  3. Identify and articulate the learning story from the spikes.
  4. Show how these spikes progress into a roadmap or potential areas to explore.
  5. Update the root README to include progress and this learning/roadmap narrative.
</task>

<steps>
  <step1>
    Scan the entire repository:
    - Identify key directories, components, and existing documentation.
    - Note any existing references to spikes, experiments, or roadmap items.
  </step1>
  <step2>
    Explore the git history:
    - Identify commits, branches, or tags corresponding to spikes and experiments.
    - Read commit messages (and PR descriptions, if available) to infer goals and outcomes of each spike.
  </step2>
  <step3>
    Synthesize a learning story:
    - For each major spike, extract: its goal, what was tried, what was learned, and how it influenced later work.
    - Group related spikes into themes (e.g., architecture, integrations, performance, UX).
  </step3>
  <step4>
    Derive roadmap and exploration areas:
    - Map spike outcomes to concrete roadmap items (features, refactors, integrations).
    - Identify open questions or unresolved findings as "potential areas to explore".
  </step4>
  <step5>
    Design README updates:
    - Decide where in the root README to insert or update sections.
    - Plan sections such as:
      - "Current Project Status / Progress"
      - "Spike History & Learning Story"
      - "Roadmap & Potential Exploration Areas"
  </step5>
  <step6>
    Edit the root README:
    - Preserve useful existing content (overview, setup, usage, etc.).
    - Add or update sections to:
      - Summarize progress to date.
      - Tell a coherent narrative of how spikes informed decisions.
      - Explicitly connect spike learnings to roadmap items and exploration areas.
  </step6>
  <step7>
    Review and refine:
    - Ensure the README is self-contained and understandable to a new contributor.
    - Check that the spike-to-roadmap connections are explicit, not implied.
    - Verify formatting and structure follow Markdown best practices.
  </step7>
</steps>

<instructions>
  - Focus updates on the root README file.
  - Treat spikes as a chronological and thematic story that explains how the project evolved.
  - Make explicit links between:
    - Individual spikes → what was learned.
    - Learnings → decisions, architectural choices, and roadmap items.
    - Open questions → "potential areas to explore".
  - Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to organize the narrative.
</instructions>

<constraints>
  - Do not remove critical existing README information unless it is clearly obsolete or superseded.
  - Keep the README readable for both technical and semi-technical stakeholders.
  - Use Markdown formatting only.
  - Ensure the learning story is specific and grounded in spike work, not generic.
</constraints>

<validation_rules>
  - The updated README must:
    - Contain a clear summary of **current project progress**.
    - Include a **"Spike History" or "Learning from Spikes"** section that references concrete spike work.
    - Explain **how spike learnings influenced the roadmap or key project decisions**.
    - List **future roadmap items and/or potential areas to explore** that are clearly traced back to spike outcomes or gaps.
    - Remain coherent and understandable without needing to read the git history directly.
  - The structure and headings must make it easy for a new contributor to:
    - Understand where the project is today.
    - See what experiments were run and why.
    - Know what is planned next or still uncertain.
</validation_rules>

<output_format>
  - Provide the **full, updated root README content** as Markdown.
  - If helpful, precede it with a short summary of the main changes.
  - Optionally include a unified diff-style snippet (old vs new) only if it clarifies how the README evolved.
</output_format>

<reasoning>
  - Silently perform multi-step reasoning:
    - Infer spike work and learnings from git history and code changes.
    - Group and prioritize spikes by impact on the project direction.
    - Translate technical details into a concise narrative suitable for the README.
  - Do not expose low-level reasoning steps in the final README text; present only the polished, user-facing documentation.
